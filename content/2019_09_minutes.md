M/S/A that Licton Springs Community Council be a sponsor for the Arts in the Park proposal entitled "Outdoor Movie and Dog Party in Mineral Springs Park as authored by neighbor Amanda Crosley and distributed to Licton Springs Community Council members by email October 12, 2018:

**OUTDOOR MOVIE & DOG PAWTY IN THE PARK 2019**

**1) Describe the activities of the festival, event, or project for which you are seeking funds. Include information about how arts and culture will be featured in your project or event. **

This event seeks to bring the community together over a free outdoor movie with booths for artists and vendors held in Mineral Springs Park. We are seeking funding for a movie public performance license, rental fees associated with a movie screen, generator, projector, marketing materials and for a port-a-potty as Mineral Springs Park does not have any public restrooms or electrical outlets. Our event will occur on a Saturday during the summer from 6 PM to 10 PM with art activities and community games held from 6 PM to 8 PM and the outdoor movie starting at sunset around 8 PM. If we receive AIP funding, the additional funds will go towards incentivizing more artists to attend, live music, children's activities (face painting, chalk, coloring, etc.) and towards increased marketing as we have found that lawn signs are very effective in previous events.

**2) Describe who will attend your event. How does your project use arts and culture to build community. Describe what your efforts will be to reach diversity populations and increase accessibility.**

The target audience for our event is the local community around Mineral Springs Park. We will leverage translated flyers and movie subtitles to increase the accessibility of our event. The movie will explore an under-represented culture such as Hispanic or Latino (ex: Coco) and be free and open to the public. We will seek out local businesses and artists for vendor spots at our event with a focus on diversity. For example, we will connect with North Seattle Community College (including the Licton Springs Review) and their Diversity Advisory Committee to reach out to students.We will also reach out to local organizations such as Epic Life Church, Aurora Licton Urban Village (ALUV) and Aurora Commons to increase our reach. Additionally, we will hand deliver flyers to transit centers, community centers, libraries, and other neighborhood gathering spots to reach those without internet access and connect with low-income neighbors.

**3) Provide a brief history of your arts programming and presenting activities. What evidence can you provide of your capacity to produce this event successfully. Describe any key partnerships. **

Licton Springs Community Council hosts annual events for the community such as the Licton Springs Halloween Walk ([https://www.facebook.com/events/308149439973556/](https://www.facebook.com/events/308149439973556/)) and monthly events such as Friends of Licton Springs work parties ([https://lictonsprings.org/work_party.pdf](https://lictonsprings.org/work_party.pdf)).

**4) Any additional clarifications?**

We will be submitting our application for 501(c)3 status this year. Additionally, we will be exploring a fiscal sponsor if our 501(c)3 status does not get approved in time. Licton Springs Community Council has non-profit status as registered in the State of Washington.

To Whom it May Concern,

The Licton Springs Community Council is in full support of the listing of Licton Springs as a historic landmark through the Landmarks Preservation Board.

Located near North Seattle College in the Licton Springs neighborhood, Licton Springs is the remnant of one of the last remaining sacred sites of the Duwamish People.  The word "Licton" is derived from the Duwamish word **líq'tәd **(pronounced LEEK'tuhd) meaning "Red Paint", a connotation of the reddish colored iron oxide from the springs.

The springs served as a location for spiritual gatherings for the Duwamish People, where they would gather annually to build sweat-lodges for cleansing.  The red ochre pigment was also collected from the springs and used as a paint for different ceremonies and to decorate longhouses and other items with spiritual imagery.  The reddish-mud was also utilized as an ointment by traditional healers.

"_For generations, the Duwamish Tribe gathered at Licton Springs, together with their relatives by marriage, in the proper season for harvesting sacred Red Ochre pigment, necessary for spiritual celebration and renewal. Like the Duwamish Tribe, neighboring First Nations consider the sacred site **líq'tәd** to be a tangible cultural property inherited from their male or female Duwamish Ancestors. As a result of inter-marriage, neighboring First Nations have a material interest in access to and preservation of the sacred site **líq'tәd**._

_Licton Springs was a therapeutic resource for the Duwamish Tribe, who built a **wúx̌təd **("WUKH-tud", "sweat lodge", sweat-house) near the springs.  A **wúx̌təd** was used to cleanse and revitalize a person's spirit, as well as their body.  For spiritual gatherings and ceremonies, the Duwamish People painted their faces with RedLICTON SPRINGS COMMUNITY COUNCIL

Jan expressed a desire to see Native American representative images of animals at the event.  Emma also discussed the work at the schools and the hope to inspire and excite the children about tribal sovereignty of the land at Licton Springs park.

Thomas Speer of Urban Native Education Alliance made a presentation, explaining as well his role as an elder and his concern for Licton Springs' historic significance. He noted that the Duwamish people have been in the area for 15,000years because tribal traditions date back to the Ice Age.  He stated that there were originally three springs at the park: Sulphur, iron oxide, and magnesium.  As of today, only the iron oxide spring is intact. He expressed dismay about the graffiti, needles, trash, excrement, and prostitution in the park. He also noted the significance of the park to the David Denny family and that David Denny, unlike other Dennys, had been a friend to local Native Americans.  Speer spoke for a group that is advocating for designation of the park as a historic landmark, with accompanying signage to explain the historic significance of the park. LSCC is requested to write a letter supporting the designation, as noted by both Thomas Speer and other visitors present such as Matt Remle, who provided a notebook of information.

Emma called for more money for education directly, rather than, for example, the money spent on the Andrew Morrison murals.  There was a general discussion about designation of historic places in Licton Springs area.

Kathleen asked questions about the impact of a historic designation o the park management of the space and wants to be cautious about potentially negative interaction between City depts. that might inadvertently be harmful to use of the park. The group at the meeting also discussed federal recognition of tribes.  Melanie affirmed Liz's role as forest steward for the park. and Kathleen gave an update on a proposal underway to DON to upgrade the signage in the park (Kathleen, Liz, Emma, Amanda Culp, and Joseph are all on the committee).

**_líq'tәd cannot be re-created, replaced, or re-located. Its importance is beyond measure and description, and its value is beyond price. The Duwamish People are the stewards of líq'tәd, other holy places and the natural endowment that dúkʷibəɬ (Creator) bestowed upon our ʔálʔaltəd_** _(Ancestral-Homeland)._

_At the beginning of time, **líq'tәd** ("Licton Springs") was given to us by **dúkʷibəɬ** (Creator) in perpetuity.  It is an inalienable part of our Patrimony, a legacy from our Ancestors, and the Cultural Heritage of the **dx<sup>w</sup>'dəwɁábš **(People-of-the-Inside), Chief Seattle's Duwamish Tribe_."

Preservation of the springs as designated as a historic site is essential in the protection and the education of Seattle's First People, the Duwamish, as well as, the history of Seattle.

Sincerely
