Your filename should have the format `YYYY_MM_minutes.md`.

The file must have the following lines at the top:

```
Title: Council Meeting Minutes MONTH YEAR
Date: YYYY-MM-DD 18:30
Category: Minutes


```
fill in the above template with the information for the meeting minutes you're adding.

For the March 2021 meeting, this would look like:

Category: Minutes


```
